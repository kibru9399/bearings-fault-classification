To this day, numerous maintenance actions follow preventive and run-to failure method. In 
this paper, it has been attempted to show the power of predictive maintenance from vibration 
data using a machine learning technique implementing Convolutional neural networks 
(CNN). 

Actual data was collected from six different bearings on a machine elementsâ€™ fault 
analysis test-rig. The bearings are of ball bearing types in which one of them is a healthy 
one and the rest are faulty at the inner race, the outer race, the rolling element, combination 
of these three and severe damage at either the rolling element or the rings. The vibration
patterns of the respective bearings were possible to be visualized in real time and were stored 
on a computer. From the vibration signatures specific to the health status of the bearings, a 
powerful deep learning Convolutional neural network model was built. from the above data set speed of 1500rpm and counter clockwise direction was used to biuld the model.

The model was able to successfully classify among the states of bearings with accuracy values ranging between 
73.2-99.9% on unseen data. This CNN model can be used as a diagnostic tool for 
undertaking maintenance operation of vibrational equipment fostering minimal 
maintenance time and competitiveness in the market as well as the trending industrial 
practices. The document at your fingertips introduces basic terminologies, identified gap 
and objectives in the first chapter. Then, after reviewing up to date practices by other 
researchers, it goes well into the tasks of data acquisition, model development and 
optimization, and predictions. It is concluded by discussing the findings and putting a way 
forward for future works
